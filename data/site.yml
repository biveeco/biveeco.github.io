  blurb: |-
    We've grown a lot since we started in 2013, and our work has evolved as well. This year, after a period of rethinking our brand and our approach, we decided to change our name to better reflect where we're headed. Our new name is **H&oslash;st**.

    We'll be rolling out our new brand over the next few months, and updating our website alongside it. Check back here soon for more on the thinking and process behind it.
